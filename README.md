# Smartschoolbus_attendance_and_tracking

The overall working process begins when the *12V Power Supply* is activated, energizing the central *ESP32 Microcontroller, the **R307 Fingerprint Module, the **GPS Module, and the **GSM/GPRS Module. When a student boards or exits the bus, they place their finger on the **R307 Fingerprint Module, which captures the image and converts it into a digital template. This template is immediately sent to the **ESP32 Microcontroller, which acts as the system's brain. The ESP32 compares the scanned template against the stored records in the **Student Database* (either locally on an SD card or in the cloud). Upon a successful match, the system registers the attendance event (recording the student's name, ID, and the time stamp). Simultaneously, the *GPS Module* provides the current real-time latitude and longitude data to the ESP32. The ESP32 then compiles a comprehensive *SMS Alert* packet containing the child's name, the time, and the current bus location link. This packet is sent to the *GSM/GPRS Module, which uses the cellular network to instantly transmit the SMS notification to the pre-registered parent's phone number. All of this attendance and location data is also logged in real-time to the **Cloud Data Logger* (like Firebase or Google Sheets) for administrative monitoring and historical record-keeping. Finally, a copy of the data is saved to the *SD Card Local Backup* as a failsafe, ensuring that no attendance record is lost even if the GSM signal is temporarily unavailable. A quick signal from the ESP32 to the *Speaker/Buzzer* provides the student and driver with immediate, audible confirmation of a successfulÂ scan.
